# Omnifood Project

## STEP 1: DEFINE THE PROJECT

- Define **Who** the site is for
  
  - For a client

- Define **What** the site is for
  
  - **Business goals:** Selling monthly food subscription
  
  - **User goals:** Eating well effortlessly, without spending a lot of time and money 

- Define target audience
  
  - Busy people who like technology, are interested in a healthy diet, and have a well-paying job

## STEP 2: PLAN THE PROJECT

- Plan and gather website content

- Plan out the sitemap
  
  - We will just build a one-page marketing website (oftentimes called a landing page), <u>so no sitemap</u>

- Define website personality
  
  - Based on the tech-centered target audience, as well as the actual product being sold, we will use the **startup/upbeat** personality. We might add some elements of the **calm/peaceful** personality, since the product is all about consumer well-being as well

- Plan page sections
  
  - Logo + Navigation
  
  - Hero
  
  - Featured in
  
  - How it works
  
  - Meals (and list of diets)
  
  - Testimonials + Gallery
  
  - Pricing + Features
  
  - CTA
  
  - Footer
